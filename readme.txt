This is project contains  implementaions of the vigenere cypher in different lanquages.  

-- From wikipedia --
-In a Caesar cipher, each letter of the alphabet is shifted along some number of places; for example, in a Caesar cipher of shift 3, A would become D, B would become E, Y would become B and so on. The Vigen√®re cipher consists of several Caesar ciphers in sequence with different shift values.

This implementation shifts characters on the ascii table between ascii values 32(space) and 126 (~). This leaves other characters like new line alone.
